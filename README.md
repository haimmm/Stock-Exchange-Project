# Stock Exchange
This is one of my first web projects and it made with only Vanilla js and lot's of love :)
This project is basically a search engine for stocks.
When the user types something in the search bar the website sends an API call using [this free stocks API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs).


Challenging thiings i learned:
- How to make an auto search using debounce to prevent too many calls.
- How to create a good looking marquee from 0.
